1. Check all highlighted errors are fixed:

Thanks, we see from the title and description text:

   Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
     Hyrdrologic (2:36)
     extractred (6:64)


If there are references describing the methods in your package, please
add these in the description field of your DESCRIPTION file in the form
authors (year) <doi:...>
authors (year) <arXiv:...>
authors (year, ISBN:...)
or if those are not available: <https:...>
with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:', 'https:' and angle brackets for
auto-linking.
(If you want to add a title as well please put it in quotes: "Title")


Please write TRUE and FALSE instead of T and F.

Please add \value to .Rd files regarding exported methods and explain
the functions results in the documentation. Please write about the
structure of the output (class) and also what the output means. (If a
function does not return a value, please document that too, e.g.
\value{No return value, called for side effects} or similar)
Missing Rd-tags:
      plotEvents.Rd: \value
      plotPairs.Rd: \value


Please make sure that you do not change the user's options, par or
working directory. If you really have to do so within functions, please
ensure with an *immediate* call of on.exit() that the settings are reset
when the function is exited. e.g.:
...
oldpar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)    # code line i
on.exit(par(oldpar))            # code line i + 1
...
par(new=TRUE)            # somewhere after

...
e.g.: R/plotPairs.R
If you're not familiar with the function, please check ?on.exit. This
function makes it possible to restore options before exiting a function
even if the function breaks. Therefore it needs to be called immediately
after the option change within a function.


In examples, vignettes and demos: Please always make sure to reset to
user's options(), working directory or par() after you changed it
e.g.:
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(1,2))
...
par(oldpar)
...
e.g. man/pairEvents.Rd, man/plotPairs.Rd

Please fix and resubmit.

Best,
Julia Haider
