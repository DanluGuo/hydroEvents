\title{Baseflow removal (after Fuka et al)}
\usage{
baseFlowA(Y, k = 0.925, passes = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{The vector series of streamflow}

\item{k}{Filter parameter}

\item{passes}{Number of passes}
}
\description{
This function removes baseflow based on a recursive digital filter and is based on
the implementation in the EcoHydRology package with initial values taken from Fuka et al. (2018).

The formulation is after Lyne and Hollick (1979) and nicely described in Furey and Gupta (2001).
Reccomended parameters are after Nathan and McMahon (1990). Additional discussion on implementations
can be found in Ladson et al (2013).
